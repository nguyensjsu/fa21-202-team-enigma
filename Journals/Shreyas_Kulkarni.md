"Courage is effective action in the face of fear" -- Kent Beck

## WEEK1
We all spent the first week searching for a suitable project to work on. Initially the team was worried on how are going to manage our time and finish the project in the stipulated time. But I had the courage to take initiative of the role as product owner to manage the backlog items and perform a thorough analysis of the the requirements for a successful hackathon. I set-up the repo, defined special roles for the team, ran everyone through the requirement and briefed on how to manage our team contributions optimally. This gave the team a strength to keep us going.

We finished deciding the project and dividing it into modules this week.
We all took up a task to integrate a design pattern into the project. We shall start code analysis in order to write clean code for optimal integration next week.
As of now, everyone's roles and user stories are defined. There are no blockers as off now.
