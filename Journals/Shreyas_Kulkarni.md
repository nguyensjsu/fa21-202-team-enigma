"Courage is effective action in the face of fear" -- Kent Beck

## WEEK1
We spent the first week searching for a suitable project to work on. Initially the team was worried on how are going to manage our time and finish the project in the stipulated time. But I had the courage to take initiative of the role as product owner to manage the backlog items and perform a thorough analysis of the the requirements for a successful hackathon. I set-up the repo, defined special roles for the team, ran everyone through the requirement and briefed them on how to manage our team contributions optimally. This gave the team courage to keep us going.

We finished deciding the project, divided it into modules and started with the analysis.
We all took up a task to integrate a design pattern into the project. We shall complete code analysis in order to write clean code for optimal integration next week.
As of now, everyone's roles and user stories are defined. There are no blockers as off now.

## Week 2

We spent this week with the functionality design to offer abstraction and extension so it doesn't break each other's code. After this was done, we started implementing the logic and writing code for it. I chose to implement the Red Obstacle which leverages the strategy pattern to display the word to be entered in reverse.

I worked on the analysis and the code that needed to be implemented, I was also finding ways to keep my block of code extensible for other team members to implement their features successfully as well.
We planned to use the next sprint to effectively integrate everyone's code and test it thoroghly.
There were hicups in between while trying to integrate and implement design patters and not break other teammate's code. But after discussing repectfully we came across a efficient solution. The only speed breakers were the integration issues between everyone's code as of now.

## Week 3

Apart from integrating and testing my code, I spent time reviewing and merging the pull requests by my teammates. I also had the courage to inform them about the changes and fixes that need to be done for a successful completion of the project. As the deadline started coming closer, i had the courage to set strict deadlines that teammates were comfortable with so we finish the project on time. 

We finished integrating and reviewing everyone's code during this time.
We planned the video ads/demo along with the documentation for the last week in our project.
Our only blockers right now was integrating everyone's code successfully on time before demo and ad shooting.

# Week 4

We spent this week in meeting and shooting our video ad and demos. This included splitting up the team to take up different documentation tasks like class diagram, collaboration diagram, deployment diagram, video editting, adding the UI screenshots to the readme and updating the readme accurately.

I helped organise and shoot the video ads, video demo, made the class diagram and added the UI screenshots.
As this was our last week we were wrapping up our project.
The only blocker we had was one teammate producing an incomplete feature for our game, we decide to not let her efforts go in vain and keep her functionality in a side branch.
