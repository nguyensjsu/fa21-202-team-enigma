- #### Why respect is important?
It is very important to respect others while working together as it encourages teammates to do their work more precisely and accurately. So overall, it leads to loyalty which increases the quality of work.

# WEEK 1

The team members decided the meeting time by respecting each other's schedule. At first, we discussed whether we should go with Application or Game. After talking over things in a depth, we all came to a conclusion to go with a Game built using Greenfoot. All other activities throughout the week like theme selection and exploring the project options were followed considering everyone's opinions. Thereafter, we started exploring what new things we need to learn for the entire project and discussed on few of them. We also traversed some games already built on Greenfoot for getting familiar with it.
