# Core value RESPECT
"When you have that respect from your teammates, it makes it a lot more comfortable" - LeBron James

- #### What respect actually means?
Respect is a way of treating or thinking about something or someone. It is about self-respect as well as respecting others. Every member respects all other teammates by listening the ideas of them and by providing best results in work and refactoring as well. 

- #### Why respect is important?
It is very important to respect others while working together as it encourages teammates to do their work more precisely and accurately. So overall, it leads to loyalty which increases the quality of work.

# WEEK 1

The team members decided the meeting time by respecting each other's schedule. At first, we discussed whether we should go with Application or Game. After talking over things in a depth, we all came to a conclusion to go with a Game built using Greenfoot. All other activities throughout the week like theme selection and exploring the project options were followed considering everyone's opinions. Thereafter, we started exploring what new things we need to learn for the entire project and discussed on few of them. We also traversed some games already built on Greenfoot for getting familiar with it.

After deciding the game, we all discussed on which features to work on using which design patterns. We respected thoughts of every teammates to select the design pattern for particular feature. At the end of week 1, we all decided to go with five features to be implemented using different design patterns. Along with that, we all talked over the documents need to be maintained throughout the project.

# WEEK 2

During this week, we spent time on code design and analysis. Features like Booster Meteors and Red Obstacles were implemented and merged with code by other teammates and I implemented my feature on top of it.

I took a feature of masked words to be implemented in game. To accomplish that feature, I added masked words feature using Factory pattern. During difficulty level 4, when a player enters alphabets they will be displayed as asterisks e.g. if a player has entered a word "action" then it will be displayed as "******" on screen. I respected a couple of suggestions given by teammates on code designing and did some modifications accordingly.

I also took care of maintaining the optimized code for my feature. In order to do that, I needed to maintain the code integrated earlier by respecting other teammates' code snippets. 

# WEEK 3

After ensuring the fact that I didn't break anyone's code and integrated required design pattern for my feature, I pulled request to be reviewed by Brinda. In the following task, we were about to merge everyone's code for the final product. Brinda reviewed the code and after making sure that everything is okay, we merged my code. I also modified the [instructions page](https://github.com/nguyensjsu/fa21-202-team-enigma/blob/brinda/latest-backup-11282021/Screenshots/Team%20Enigma%20-%20%20Instructions.png) to include the additional features' descriptions in it.

The only hurdle was to merge everyone's code so the team finalized the code by integration first. Then, we planned a meet for video shooting with the final code. In addition to that, I spent time on maintaining the readme file of the game. 

# WEEK 4

After integrating and testing the final code, the only task remaining was to finish the remaining documentations. All team members split up the tasks for documentation e.g. class diagram, collaboration diagram, deployment diagram, updating the readme file and video editing stuffs. I completed the video shooting and editing part for game demo as well as ad.

I shot the videos needed for ad and demo of the game. Then I merged clips and did required editing using iMovie editor. After completing the task, I uploaded demo and user story video on youtube. Now, we were about to put a full stop to our journey on this game. As a final task, I did some final touch up in readme such as adding burndown chart screenshot, internal links of journals, game demo link and user story video in readme.
