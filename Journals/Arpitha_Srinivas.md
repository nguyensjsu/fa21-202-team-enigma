..it is simplicity that is difficult to make. - Bertholdt Brecht

Week1:

As a team we met and introduced each other and agreed to research on the projects. Each team member came up with game application which they thought is interesting to understand and apply design patterns. With the emphasis on my core value which is "simplicity" I came up with simple project which could be understood by each of the team member and explained and ran the game application , as per feedback received by the Professor and team, in order to apply the design pattern javascript would not be a better choice hence we chose one more interesting game application shared by team member which is developed in java Greenfoot.
We analyzed the modules each of the team member should work on. We discussed and added and modified the feature we think we can implement and extend the existing functionality.Each of the team member was assigned with a feature to work on. This week we selected which game application to work on and assigned with a feature to implement 5 of the functionalities.


Week2:

I was assigned to work on play and pause functionality for the spacetyper game. This week as a team we discussed how to avoid any conflicts if we have to use the same class or code. I spent time on researching which design pattern would be appropriate to use in this implementation. I analyzed initially 2 patterns which seemed appropriate and then after researching finalized to apply command pattern for this implementation. Went over class notes for command pattern and started analyzing the design. Researched on Greenfoot API and in built functionality for the play and pause functionality.

Week3:

This week I created Icmnd, conceretecmnd ,IReceiver, PlayReceiver, PauseReceiver,PlayPause actor to achieve the feature using command pattern. Most challenging part was  Greenfoot.start() in built functionality was not working as expected to achieve play and pause functionality on click of mouse. Tried applying the in built functionality on a different scenario as it did not work as mentioned in the documentation. Had to think of new way to achieve this functionality and informed team regarding this issue during the team meeting. Finally tried delay method to implement the feature and was able to achieve the play and pause functionality by taking key input. Also spent some time on learning the github commands. Created pull request to merge the code.


Week4:

We did code testing before merging the code to the main branch and found on pause the reset functionality of Greenfoot was going to loop on click of reset button and hence the team decided to keep the implementation on the branch itself. Spent time on debugging this issue. And also spent time on creating the class diagram for the play/pause feature and recorded the feature demo video. Also updated all pending documents.
