..it is simplicity that is difficult to make. - Bertholdt Brecht

Week1:

As a team we came together and introduced each other and agreed to research on the projects. Each team member came up with game application which they thought is interesting to understand and apply design patterns. With the emphasis on my core value which is "simplicity" I came up with simple project which could be understood by each of the team member and explained and ran the game application , as per team feedback and professor feedback in order to apply the design pattern javascript would not be a better choice hence we choose one more interesting game application shared by team member which is developed in java Greenfoot.

As a team we analyzed the modules each of the team member should work on. We discussed and added and modified the feature we think we can implement and extend the existing functionality.Each of the team member was assigned with a feature to work on. This week we selected which game application to work on and assigned with a feature to implement 5 of the functionalities.
