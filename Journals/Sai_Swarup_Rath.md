## XP CORE VALUE ASSIGNED: COMMUNICATION 

### Why is Communication important?
Kent Beck in his book explains- "Whenever you have a problem, think about how it could have been resolved with better communication..". Software development is inherently a team sport that relies on communication to transfer knowledge from one team member to everyone else on the team. Without effective communication, there can be missing out on deadlines and less clarity on issues among the team, which ultimately leads to bad software. Hence, with regular discussion and meetings, our team ensures that effective communication value is always maintained.

## WEEK 1
Weekly meeting was conducted at the start of the week and everyone being an equal part of the team communicated their ideas enthusiastically. All team members first researched on various games and projects which can be chosen to be developed using greenfoot and design patterns using java. After a proper discussion it was decided in our regular meeting that we will be working on Space Typer game and adding various functionalities in it. We all liked a game in Javascript. But after getting the feedback, it was decided that Javascript is not the best choice right now for design patterns implementation. Therefore, we moved forward with a game developed in Greenfoot(Space Typer). 

Post the discussion, we created tasks and divided these tasks among ourselves. There were also daily face-to-face meetings for 15-20 minutes and communication on completed work and problems if any, so that others can help. I strongly feel these steps set the tone on proper implementation of the targets set for our project moving forward. The major focus of these meetings were 3 questions:

### What did you do yesterday?

### What will you do today?

### Are there any impediments on your way?



## WEEK 2
After regular meetings and connects we successfully divided various modules that each of us had to work on for the coming days.
I was assigned the feature to implement a scoreboard that would display the top 10 scores of the game when the game was over.
The final score by the user post all shields were lost was already being displayed in the game over screen, and so I dug deep inside the various classes of the game to see how to expand on it and display the top ten scores of the game.

Post research I created a new feature through git and started working on my changes using a pull request.
I had some confusions while progressing so I took help from Brinda and Sagar on how to work on the changes using git.
After creating new classes and applying on the game, I found that the existing functionality were all working well and my new changes were not hampering them.
The top ten scores were getting displayed on the click of the "TOP 10" button that I had added in the end screen. I informed the team and asked Shreyas for feedback and review on the design changes that I had done.



## WEEK 3
After a thorough review from Shreyas I received few review comments and changes that had to be done for my feature. I removed the TOP 10 button in the end screen and instead added button called scoreboard that displayed the top 10 scores post clicking it. A proper background was setup for the top 10 scores screen which was not coming up while testing it. I ensured that my changes were not affecting the end screen placements for other buttons and traits. The flashlight functionality was also removed in the end screen so that everything was displayed properly while going to the endscreen post the game was over.

While pushing my commits I faced few challenges in the pull request in github and while manually doing git pull from terminal in my mac. I connected with Brinda who helped me in managing to extend my commits to my branch and do a proper merging with the main branch of our team project repository. There were frequent scrum meetings throughout the week to discuss on backlogs and how to resolve them as fast as possible to start working on the user story and demo videos before the deadline.



## WEEK 4
While we all were done with our feature implementations, it was now time to focus on preparing user story video and demo video. I sent out a metting invite and we all met to focus on our parts and make both of the videos to accurately represent our tasks and the major functionalities of the game. Me, Sagar, Shreyas, Brinda and Arpitha were all present and worked on a proper template on how to prepare the videos and then update the links in README.  We all contributed with various ideas on how to make the video interesting and handling all the necessary details of the game. While it was decided that Shreyas wil be working on the class diagram, the onus on developing the deployment and architecture diagrams came on me.

Hence, I researched first on how to properly present the architecture and deployment diagrams of a greenfoot project. I found some examples and after going through all our development source files and making notes, I decided to give it a go. Post completing the diagrams I asked for review from my teammates and through proper communication was able to successfully complete both the diagrams.
