## XP CORE VALUE ASSIGNED: COMMUNICATION 

### Why is Communication important?
Kent Beck in his book explains- "Whenever you have a problem, think about how it could have been resolved with better communication..". Software development is inherently a team sport that relies on communication to transfer knowledge from one team member to everyone else on the team. Without effective communication, there can be missing out on deadlines and less clarity on issues among the team, which ultimately leads to bad software. Hence, with regular discussion and meetings, our team ensures that effective communication value is always maintained.

## WEEK1
Weekly meeting was conducted at the start of the week and everyone being an equal part of the team communicated their ideas enthusiastically. All team members first reserached on various games and projects which can be chosen to be developed using greenfoot and design patterns using java. After a proper discussion it was decided in our regular meeting that we will be working on Space Typer game and adding various functionalities in it. Post the discussion, we created tasks and divided these tasks among ourselves. There were also daily face-to-face meetings for 15-20 minutes and communication on completed work and problems if any, so that others can help. I strongly feel these steps set the tone on proper implementation of the targets set for our project moving forward.


## WEEK2
After regular meetings and connects we successfully divided various modules that each of us had to work on for the coming days. I was assigned the feature to implement a scoreboard that would display the top 10 scores of the game when the game was over. The final score by the user post all shields were lost was already being displayed in the game over screen, and so I dug deep inside the various classes of the game to see how to expand on it and display the top ten scores of the game.

Post research I created a new feature through git and started working on my changes using a pull request. I had some confusions while progressing so I took help from Brinda and Sagar on how to work on the changes using git. After creating new classes and applying on the game, I found that the existing functionality were all working well and my new changes were not hampering them. The top ten scores were getting displayed on the click of the "TOP 10" button that I had added in the end screen. I informed the team and asked Shreyas for feedback and review on the design changes that I had done.
